The mean of the data is only 2.45 with a SD of 3.6. It doesn't really need the graph to go all the way to 7. While its true that the graph has a max of 7.1, that can be represented with a crumpled axis from 5 - 7. The way the graph currently is set up shrinks majority of the data, which makes it difficult to make any meaninful conclusion. "

    "#### An Important Note on One Hot Encoding \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, simply fixing these missing values isn't sufficient for using `Roof Material` in our model.  Since `Roof Material` is a categorical variable, we will have to one-hot-encode the data.  Notice in the example code below that we have to pre-specify the categories. For more information on categorical data in pandas, refer to this [link](https://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/user_guide/categorical.html). For more information on why we want to use one-hot-encoding, refer to this [link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following function `ohe_roof_material` that returns a dataframe with the new column one-hot-encoded on the roof material of the household. These new columns should have the form `x0_MATERIAL`. Your function should return a new DataFrame, not modify the existing DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You should **avoid using `pd.get_dummies`** in your solution as it will remove your original column and is therefore not as reusable as your constructed data preprocessing pipeline. Instead, you can one-hot-encode one column into multiple columns **using Scikit-learn's [One Hot Encoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)**. It's far more customizable!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: To get you started with this subpart, here is code that initializes a `OneHotEncoding` pre-processing \"model\" from Scikit-learn and fits it on a simple dataset containing (some of) the first names of your instructional staff this summer! Please play with this code before jumping into the roof material data if you are unsure how to approach the question using `OneHotEncoder`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> oh_enc = OneHotEncoder()\n",
    ">>> oh_enc.fit([['Anirudhan'], ['Dominic'], ['Rahul'], ['Rahul'], ['Anirudhan'], ['Yike'], ['Vasanth']]);\n",

Creating a house-pricing model for Cook County has some challenging social implications to think, though, however. This will be addressed in Lecture 14 on July 14 (pretty cool coincidence?!) and Thursday's discussion."
